# Archean_hydrothermal_SW_mixing
Thermodynamic databases used in reaction path models reported in "Hydrothermal vent fluid - seawater mixing and the origin of Archean iron formation"
Three databases are included in this repository, all of which were generated with pyGeochemCalc by NJ Tosca (Awolayo, A. N. & Tutolo, B. M. PyGeochemCalc: A Python package for geochemical thermodynamic calculations from ambient to deep Earth conditions. Chem Geol 606, 120984 (2022).)
Databases were modified according to details outlined in Tosca, N.J. and Tutolo, B.M., in review, Hydrothermal vent fluid - seawater micing and the origin of Archean iron formation. Geochim Cosmochim Acta.)
